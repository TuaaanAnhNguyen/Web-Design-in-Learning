        <h1>Godfrey, the First Elden Lord</h1>
        <h2>The Legendary Warrior</h2>
        <p>Godfrey stands as a towering symbol of lordship and strength. As the first husband of Queen Marika the Eternal and the father of three—Godwyn the Golden, and the Omen Twins—his legacy is deeply etched in the annals of history. The Omens, often seen as a curse, were spared from execution due to Godfrey's influence, instead hidden away beneath the surface. His leadership of the Crucible Knights, divine beings with ties to the Omens, further showcases his unparalleled might.</p>
        <p>Godfrey's story is a tapestry of glorious battles and profound trials. After achieving monumental victories, Queen Marika stripped him of his grace, rendering him the first Tarnished and banishing him from the Lands Between. Undeterred, Godfrey waged wars in distant lands, awaiting the call of grace he knew would come again—a sign that Marika sought to strengthen him for a greater purpose, to challenge the god controlling her and free the land from the Greater Will.</p>
        <h2>Legacy and Influence</h2>
        <p>His loyal Crucible Knights, upon learning of his banishment, scattered in their allegiances. Some remained steadfast in defending Leyndell, the capital that ousted him, while others, like one who joined the Volcano Manor, protested the Erdtree's regime. Many chose to watch over Godfrey's bloodline, protecting the demigods, his children and stepchildren, ensuring the continuation of his lineage.</p>
        <p>Godfrey's influence reached beyond his own kin. His strength and bravery inspired Radahn, another revered demigod, particularly during the fierce battles against the giants.</p>
        <p>Godfrey, once known as Hoarah Loux, was a chieftain of the badlands renowned for his immense physical power. To ascend as a true lord, he forged a vow with Serosh, the Lord of Beasts, to tame his insatiable bloodlust for battle.</p>
