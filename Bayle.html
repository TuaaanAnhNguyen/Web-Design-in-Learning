        <h1>Bayle the Dread</h1>
        <h2>Enemy of the Dragonlord</h2>
        <p>Bayle the Dread was a legendary black dragon, believed to be the ancestor of the drakes or lesser dragons. Long ago, Bayle betrayed the Ancient dragons and clashed with Dragonlord Placidusax. Their vicious battle ended in a stalemate, leaving both dragons grievously injured. Bayle lost his two winged arms, his wings on his back, and his left leg, fleeing to the Jagged Peak soon afterwards.</p>
        <h2>Dragon Communion</h2>
        <p>As punishment for his betrayal, Placidusax created the art of Dragon Communion, sending his followers to shepherd humanity into hunting Bayle and his descendants. Florissax, a servant of Placidusax, led the charge, recruiting mortals to hunt Bayle. Despite their efforts, Bayle's dread persisted, with his biatrial heart becoming a symbol of the communion's power.</p>
        <p>Dragonslayer Igon, an obsessive drake warrior, faced Bayle but was left broken in body and spirit. He vowed vengeance, creating weapons imbued with his agony and obsession to defeat Bayle. Eventually, with the aid of a Tarnished champion, Igon summoned his spirit to face Bayle once more, and together, they succeeded in slaying the dread dragon.</p>
        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
        <p>Bayle's legacy as a fearsome dragon continues to influence the world of Elden Ring. His willpower endures even after his heart is consumed at the Grand Altar of Dragon Communion, symbolizing his unyielding spirit and the eternal struggle between dragons and mortals.</p>
