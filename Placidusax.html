        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>In the prehistoric era before the age of the Erdtree, the world was ruled by the Ancient Dragons. Above them all was Placidusax, a many-headed Ancient Dragon who ruled as Elden Lord from the royal city of Farum Azula.</p>
        <p>At some point, Placiudsax was betrayed by one of his own; Bayle the Dread. Bayle inflicted a grievous wound upon the Dragonlord before fleeing, eventually coming to reside in the Realm of Shadow. Placidusax had his servants shepherd the humans into hunting Bayle and his brood, the drakes, laying the foundations of Dragon Communion.</p>
        <p>When Placidusax's god fled, the Dragonlord resolved to await its return, withdrawing to his seat at the heart of the storm beyond time. Farum Azula became a mausoleum enshrining Placidusax, guarded by chosen Beastmen. In his absence, the age of the Erdtree began under the rule of Queen Marika the Eternal, and the descendants of the Ancient Dragons became enfeebled, weak to the primeval lightning wielded by their forebears. Placidusax's Gravel Stone Scales were disseminated throughout the world, used as smithing stones said to allow for the creation of god-slaying weapons by lightly twisting time.</p>
        <p>Despite his stasis, Placidusax continued to grant blessings to his followers.</p>
        <p>A Tarnished eventually finds their way into Placidusax's seat at the heart of the storm while exploring Farum Azula in search of the Rune of Death. They approach Placidusax, who attempts to ward off the intruder. Placidusax ultimately falls to the Tarnished interloper, dying without ever being reunited with their missing god.</p>
